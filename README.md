# Plenoptic Metalenses

CST microwave studio results linking pillar rotation and geometry to output phase.

A phase mapping program for MATLAB including a UI that maps pillar rotation and geometery to phase change in a metlense to allow for full metalens phase map generation.

A Python app including baisc Tkinter GUI to reconstuct images from an equivalent ray-traced Blender model, to give a prediction of the quality of output HDR and depth sensing images.
